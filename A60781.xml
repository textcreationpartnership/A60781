            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </list>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. THAT the <hi>Old Company,</hi> before the late Act for Settling the Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Idies,</hi> had no Right in Law to the Trade to <hi>India,</hi> Excluſive of all others, nor any Right by their Charters, but what was ſubject to a Proviſo upon being Diſſolved upon Three years Notice, has been in ſeveral Prints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably made out; And the Honourable Houſe of Commons Twice Addreſs'd the King to Diſſolve them; Afterwards the <hi>Old Company</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Houſe to Lend 700000 <hi>l.</hi> to have the Trade to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, excluſive of others, for Thirty one years; And the Houſe wanting Money for the Service of the Government, and being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Settle the Trade to <hi>India,</hi> invited all Perſons to make Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to that purpoſe; Others, not of the <hi>Company,</hi> propoſed to Lend Two Millions, and to demonſtrate the Probability of Advancing that Sum, did in a few days Subſcribe about 1300000 <hi>l.</hi> and brought in their Subſcriptions and Propoſal to the Houſe, which was accepted; and in purſuance thereof, an Act paſſed, with ſuch Conditions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, and Regulations, as the Parliament thought proper; And,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 760. <hi>P.</hi> 780.</note> particularly, the Sole Trade to <hi>India</hi> was granted to ſuch as ſhould Lend Money upon the Fund Settled by the ſaid Act, ſubject to a Power of Redemption by Parliament upon Three years Notice after the 29th of <hi>September</hi> 1711. and no otherwiſe, nor in any ſhorter time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>New Company</hi> having Subſcribed to the ſaid Loan 1663000 <hi>l.</hi> became thereupon poſſeſſed of the ſaid Right of Trade for that Sum yearly, according to the ſaid Act, and His Majeſty's Charter founded thereon; and many of the Members of the ſaid Company diverted themſelves from other Affairs, ſold Tallies at great loſs, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe put themſelves to Streights to Serve the Government, by the Advance of the ſaid Money; tho' at the ſame time they could have
<pb facs="tcp:34738:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>bought Tallies that carried Eight <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt on Parliamentary Funds, at 30 and 25 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> loſs, that is to ſay, 100 <hi>l.</hi> for 70 or 75 <hi>l.</hi> And this they did in confidence of enjoying the Agreement ſtipulated with them by the moſt Publick and Solemn Act the Nation is capable of. In purſuance of this Contract the <hi>New Company</hi> have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended great Sums in Settling themſelves, and great Factories in ſeveral parts of <hi>India,</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Borneo.</hi> And therefore the ſaid Agreement cannot with Right be broken, nor the ſaid Trade taken away from the Perſons in whom the Property is veſted, nor has ſuch a thing ever been done by any Parliament.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As their Propoſal relates to ſuch as ſhall come in and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe;</p>
            <p n="1">1. They, are only to be allowed a limited Sum, and muſt come in upon a certain Valuation of the <hi>Old Companies</hi> Stock, which conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the large Engagements and Claims they are under, and lyable, to in <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> if any be ſo unwary as to be drawn in and diſapointed in the real value of it, as many were by unwarrantable Artifices upon the laſt Subſcription to the <hi>Old Companies</hi> Stock, it will occaſion great Complaints by thoſe who will juſtly blame them, who have been the cauſe of their Misfortune.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They can have no Security, that the Trade granted them, will not be taken from them in another Parliament, be their Right never ſo clear in the Apprehenſion of themſelves, and the reſt of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As it relates to the Credit of the Nation, nothing can be more fatal to that, than a Propoſal to the Parliament to break a Solemn Agreement made with Perſons without Doors in a matter that meerly relates to Property as this does; The Reference from the Houſe to the Committe is to receive Propoſals for Paying off the Debts of the Nation, and advancing the Publick Credit; and this would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to deſtroy the Publick Credit, for Credit is the ſame in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Societies as in Private Men; Nothing gains or preſerves Credit to a Man, but a punctual Compliance with his Contracts and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the failing therein deſtroys his Credit, and no body will afterwards truſt him that does ſo. The Caſe will be the ſame with the Parliament; if they break one Contract, by the ſame Rule they may break all; and he that lends Money or purchaſes either the Forfeited Eſtates in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any other Eſtates, may have the ſame taken away in whole or in part, whenever the Parliament pleaſes: The Conſequence whereof will be, That no body will lend or purchaſe on ſuch precarious Security, let the Neceſſities of the Government be never ſo great.</p>
